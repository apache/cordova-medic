####### CHANGESOURCES

# the 'change_source' setting tells the buildmaster how it should find out

# from buildbot.changes.svnpoller import SVNPoller)

# For example, if you had CVSToys installed on your repository, and your
# CVSROOT/freshcfg file had an entry like this:
#pb = ConfigurationSet([
#    (None, None, None, PBService(userpass=('foo', 'bar'), port=4519)),
#    ])

# then you could use the following buildmaster Change Source to subscribe to
# the FreshCVS daemon and be notified on every commit:
#
#from buildbot.changes.freshcvs import FreshCVSSource
#fc_source = FreshCVSSource("cvs.example.com", 4519, "foo", "bar")
#c['change_source'] = fc_source

# or, use a PBChangeSource, and then have your repository's commit script run
# 'buildbot sendchange', or use contrib/svn_buildbot.py, or
# contrib/arch_buildbot.py :
#
#from buildbot.changes.pb import PBChangeSource
#c['change_source'] = PBChangeSource()

## NOTES
#
# add 'fileIsImportant = isGlobalImportant' to any project scheduler(s)
# that you want to apply this global list to.
#
# Projects can individually extend this global default :
#
# Place something like this in the projects/$project.conf file:
#
# $projectExcludes = [masterExcludes , "exclude.me" , "andme.too" , "etc..."]

####### BUILDERS

# the 'builders' list defines the Builders. Each one is configured with a
# dictionary, using the following keys:
#  name (required): the name used to describe this bilder
#  slavename (required): which slave to use, must appear in c['bots']
#  builddir (required): which subdirectory to run the builder in
#  factory (required): a BuildFactory to define how the build is run
#  periodicBuildTime (optional): if set, force a build every N seconds

# buildbot/process/factory.py provides several BuildFactory classes you can
# start with, which implement build processes for common targets (GNU
# autoconf projects, CPAN perl modules, etc). The factory.BuildFactory is the
# base class, and is configured with a series of BuildSteps. When the build
# is run, the appropriate buildslave is told to execute each Step in turn.

# the first BuildStep is typically responsible for obtaining a copy of the
# sources. There are source-obtaining Steps in buildbot/steps/source.py for
# CVS, SVN, and others.

# cvsroot = ":pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/buildbot"

# before you have a functioning 'sources' set up). The debug tool uses the
# same port number as the slaves do: 'slavePortnum'.

#c['debugPassword'] = "debugpassword"

# if you set 'manhole', you can ssh into the buildmaster and get an
# interactive python shell, which may be useful for debugging buildbot

# use an authorized_keys file, or plain telnet.

# with an externally-visible host name which the buildbot cannot figure out
# without some help.
